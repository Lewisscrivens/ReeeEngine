# ReeeEngine

This project is a GameEngine I am developing using DirectX11 but I do plan on suporting multiple render API's once I have everything working 
the way I want it. It is originally developed for my Advanced Computer Games Development module in my final year at The University of Huddersfield.

Current engine structure:

I have been doing allot of research recently around engine strucure and pieplines to make the engine more performant 
and I have mostly used The Cherno and Planet Chilli as good refference points for different features/functionality I wanted. 
I have tried to build on what they have done as much as possible in all areas as I aim to have this engine working in a similar 
way you program in Unreal Engine 4 C++.

I currently have a simple game object and component system that I am still improving and working on alongside adding more rendering
features to the engine such as textures, dynamic lighting etc.
 
NOTE: Project currently on hold but I plan to come back whenever I can as I am using it as an educational tool to get a lower level
understanding of both rendering pipelines and low level C++ programming.
